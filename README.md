# UKB WES HLA calling

This contains the code to reproduce results in the paper. It is split in 8 sections for ease. There is no attempt at making this "ready to go", and users will need to adapt some of the code for their local clusters (e.g. path to different files), especially for analyses of the HLA alleles calling results (e.g. association studies).
