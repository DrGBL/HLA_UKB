# Polygenic score

This section contains sample code for the polygenic score using LDpred and XGboost. Note that the LDpred code largely follows the tutorial here: https://choishingwan.github.io/PRS-Tutorial/ldpred/. This link also contains links to the pre-processed HapMap3 reference used in the analysis.
