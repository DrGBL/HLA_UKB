# Polygenic score

This section contains sample code for the polygenic score using LDpred and XGboost. Note that the LDpred code largely follows the tutorial here: https://choishingwan.github.io/PRS-Tutorial/ldpred/. This link also contains links to the pre-processed HapMap3 reference used in the analysis. Similarly the bayesian optimization used to find the best XGboost hyperparameters was adapted from a comment in this thread here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35050846/xgboost-in-r-how-does-xgb-cv-pass-the-optimal-parameters-into-xgb-train.
