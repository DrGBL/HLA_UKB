# Docker

This folder provides the necessary elements to build the HLA-HD docker. This docker image is used in the DNA Nexus workflow.

Note that due to copyrights, the docker image used for the analysis cannot be made public. Users are referred to the HLA-HD website to register and access the software (free).

Once they have the software, they can use the Dockerfile here to build the docker image, and push it to their dockerhub repository.

## Prerequisites:
Need to have the bowtie2 source zip files and the HLA-HD source tar.gz file in the Dockerimage directory.

For our pipeline we used bowtie2 v2.4.4 and HLD-HD v1.4.0.
