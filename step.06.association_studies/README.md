# Step 06: association studies

These files provide the necessary code for all HLA association studies. Note that for brevity, examples are provided only for HLA allele association studies from WES HLA calling, but the exact same regenie code was also used for amino acid association studies or for imputed HLA alleles (simply need to change the plink input files in step 02).

The HLA_SPREAD.zip file contains the HLA-SPREAD database used for the analysis. Please refer to the following website for more information: https://hla-spread.igib.res.in/
